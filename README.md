# Pelen
So, we are to make a pelen.

An RC plane inspired from [Mitsubishi A6M Zero](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitsubishi_A6M_Zero).

- Final wing CAD files: `A6M/Plans/fin_v2/fin3`
- Gcodes for 3-D printing: `A6M/Plans/fin_v2/3d_print_parts`
- Wing Measurements: `A6M/Plans/Wing Measurements`


OKAY MAJOR INFO HERE, READ BEFORE YOU TRY ANYTHING:

1. The design will work very well if you can somehow manage to get it printed with LW PLA (lightweight PLA). Try asking the IC for it, they may have it.
2. The current design is very very stable in itself, but the weight of the whole bird ended up being a lot more than what canbe safely hand launched. Mind you this will still fly, but you will need to either catapult it, throw it down a hill, or put landing gear on it. The estimated stall speed using Prandtl's lifting line theory for the current mass is about 10 m/s.
3. The tailplane was designed in haste so it is not as optimised as the rest of this bird when it comes to mass, so it ended up bein about 100-200 grams more than it needed to be. Please consider designing similar structures on the insides of the tailplane as there is inside the main wings, for effective weight reduction.
